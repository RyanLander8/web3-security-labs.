# Broken Access Control Lab

This lab demonstrates a **Broken Access Control** vulnerability in a Node.js application, simulating a Web3 API that exposes user data without proper authentication. The endpoint `/users/:id` allows anyone to access sensitive user information, such as wallet addresses and balances, by changing the `id` parameter. ðŸ˜±
